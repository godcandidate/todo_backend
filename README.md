## 📚 About the Project

The Todo App Backend powers the frontend of the Todo App by managing tasks and handling user interactions via a RESTful API. It is built using the **MERN stack** for efficient and scalable task management.

---

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **API Documentation**: Easily explore endpoints.
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity with schema validation.
- **Testing**: Robust unit and integration tests.

---

## ☕️ 🐍 ⚛️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - Backend runtime
- **Express.js** - Fast and minimalist web framework
- **MongoDB** - Database for persistent storage
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB
- **Jest & Supertest** - Testing framework and HTTP assertion library
- **ESLint** - JavaScript linting tool for code consistency

---

## Architecture

This backend is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Models**: Define the structure of data stored in MongoDB.
- **Controllers**: Handle business logic for API endpoints.
- **Routes**: Define endpoint mappings and middleware.
- **Middleware**: Handle authentication, validation, and error handling.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godcandidate/todo_backend.git
   cd todo_backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your API at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/v1
   ```

### Key Folders
- **`controllers/`**: Application logic for endpoints.
- **`models/`**: MongoDB schemas and data logic.
- **`routes/`**: Endpoint definitions.
- **`tests/`**: Unit and integration test cases.

---

## Customization

To tailor the backend to your needs:

1. Add new models in `models/`.
2. Create corresponding controllers and routes.
3. Update environment variables in `.env`.
4. Adjust ESLint rules in `.eslintrc.json` if needed.

---

## Testing

Run tests using Jest and Supertest:

1. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

2. Watch mode for development:
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   # or
   yarn test:watch
   ```

3. Coverage report:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   # or
   yarn test:coverage
   ```

---

## Deployment

To deploy the backend:

1. Build the production-ready version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

You can deploy it to platforms like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

---

## 🚶 Approach

The backend was developed using:
- Component-based architecture for scalable and maintainable code.
- RESTful design principles for API interactions.
- Extensive testing for reliability.
